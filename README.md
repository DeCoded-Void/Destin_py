# Destin_py (WIP)
This is the module that is used for my public bot on Discord. It features most of the available endpoints that should be needed to pull out any necessary info from the Destiny 2 api. Examples of use given the requirements are provided in the root of this project. 
For use with Discord, please refer to "Placeholder - will add bot link later".
